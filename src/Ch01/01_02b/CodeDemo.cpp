#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hi There!" << std::endl; //cout means character output and endl means end line

    std::cout << std::endl << std::endl; // adding 2 lines of space between the hello msg and the debugger's msg for niceness/better visibility in the output
    return(0); //when you get 0 it means that the code ran successfully without errors
}
